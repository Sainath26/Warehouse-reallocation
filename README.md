# Warehouse Reallocation

This project is currently being built. More details will be added soon.

Here is the description of the project

- Business need: - I am a business owner of a warehousing and distribution company. I have a warehouse in Newcastle which we are relocating to new premises in Sheffield. All our stock must all be transported to the new warehouse in the shortest possible time. - The items are of vastly varying shapes, sizes and weights – e.g. boxes, cylinders and spheres. - All my trucks are identical with side-loading doors (curtains). Length 14m, Width 2.8m, Door Height 2.8m.
  Their maximum cargo weight is 10,000 kg.

- Outcomes:
  - An application which calculates the fewest journeys needed to transfer all my stock between the two locations.
  - It must also provide information on how to load the lorries (i.e. which items to load where on the truck). This needs to consider the weight of individual items (we can’t stack a car engine on top of headlamp bulbs…)
